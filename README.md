# Portfolio Assignment


## The User Story
When you first open my application, you will find my name and my photo in the header. After the header, you will find the nav bar with links to the different sections of my portfolio: "About Me", "Work", "Contact", and "Resume." Each link corresponds with the header of the matching name, except "Resume." If you click the "Resume" link, it will take you to a new tab with a brief resume mock-up. Also, if you click the header title, "Briana Brucato's Portfolio" it will automatically take you back to the homepage. 

In the "Work" section of my portfolio, the photos are titled with the project names and when the photo is hovered over it becomes opaque and will enlarge. The photos also work as links, so once they are clicked, a new tab opens and brings you to the website I had worked on.  

For accessibility and functionality of the website, when the screen size is smaller than 992px the site's elements shrink to 50% in order to prevent distortions. When the screen size is smaller than 768px, the site adjusts once more to ensure that all the contents remain undistorted. There is also alt-text for all the images, including the "Work" ones to meet accessibility standards.
